Thanks for coming by! :wave:

This page serves as the obligatory "about me"  and "about this website"  page. Every website needs one, no? Let's go! :)

## About me

I enjoy improving. Improving myself, improving my skills, improving a project, a codebase, a piece of audio, a piece of narrative.

### As developer

As developer, i enjoy working on (mainly) web-based experiences. I have worked as a de veloper for about 6 years now and have seen a variety of tech stacks, including:

- PHP/Laravel
- Python/Django
- Ruby/Rails
- Javascript/Node.JS, ExpresJS, VueJS, React

Next to that, I am a certified accessibility expert, which comes with strong, in-depth knowledge of HTML5 according to it's intended specification, as well as WCAG execution, screen reader use, ARIA knowledge and subject matter expertise regarding accessibility matters.

### As linguist/language learner

Accessibility, as mentioned above is a foundational component of pretty much everything I work on. In my linguistic pursuits, which are a big hobby of mine, The same is true. Some examples of what I'm working on include:

- Making the knowledge of how to render IPA (International Phonetic ALphabet study more accessible for blind learners)
- Figuring out and documenting language learning strategies for various challenging languages with a screen reader (Japanese, Mandarin, Hindi, general usable tooling for learners etc)

### As Public Speaker / Blogger / advocate / teacher
A lot of specialized knowledge in various fields, be it accessibility, linguistics, cyber security etc. is out there, but nobody knows about it.
It will be stored in the heads of the lucky few; people have had to pick up the street smarts to do what they do on a daily basis.
That's where I try to come in. I figure something out, I make it accessible both in a technological as well as an intellectual sense and I put it out there for others to use. That can be through a blog post, a talk, a post to a mailing list. Google me, my name returns frighteningly many hits. :)

## About this website

This website was pretty much a natural conclusion to a few problems I was having:

- Medium, at it's core, is a very inaccessible platform. I can't be a proponent of accessibility and be on a platform that quite clearly does not care about this crucial aspect of software development and UX. Therefore, my blog needed a home.
- I'm a developer first and foremost. Therefore, I needed the obligatory portfolio website.
- I figure out a bunch of things on a pretty regular basis. Why last week, I learned about the Japanese Braille Alphabet. I'm sure others are curious about this kind of thing, if not now then down the line, so that information needs a home.

This website aims to do all that. Portfolio, blog, ways to reach out. What else? ...I honestly don't know yet. We'll see :)
